# Aircraft Image Detection System #

## Edge Detection Overview ##
This edge detection system is designed to digest images captured by the SkyScan system and determine whether there is an aircraft fully in frame or not. A lack of aircraft in the image can occur if the aircraft the system was tracking when the image was taken was occluded (e.g., behind a building, tree, etc.) or too distant. 

## Installation ##
The edge detection system uses docker compose and runs two services, one to move files out of the file structure generated by the SkyScan system into a central location (the `filemover` service) and the other to perform aircraft localization and detection (the `ai` service). 

In order to properly run the localization service, a weights file (commonly `weights.pt` or `localizer.pt`) must be placed in the `/weights` directory, which will then be mounted inside of the container. 

## Operation ##

Both services can be launched using the command `docker compose up` if run in this `edge-detect` directory. The ai service will then begin taking raw images from `/flash/unprocessed` (placed there by the filemover service) or another volume specified in its place in the Dockerfile included in the `ai` folder. It then sorts them into `plane` and `noplane` folders also located, with the current configuration, under `/flash`. 

Additionally, the location of planes within each image is saved to JSON files under `/flash/log`.
